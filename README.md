# From Nand to Tetris
Building a Modern Computer From First Principles
#### This repository contains my work for the nand2tetris course https://www.nand2tetris.org/

- ### What is Nand2tetris? 
> Nand2tetris it's a iniciative from Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan
> in which they seek to teach CS and non-CS students to see the big picture
> of how a computer system works 

- ### How it works?
   You start in the lowest level of abstraction in a CS point of view, only with a NAND gate, and climb all the way up, to develop a game in a high-level language running on a computer system that you developed from scratch!
